We observed that, the envelope of the Coverage converged to 0.68 for high mu and start at zero. It may follow the root function of a higher power.
The Plot shows diffrent probabilitys for one mu, if mu is greater than 0.5.
You may can interpret the continous part of the plot as subfunction for discret mu. While the uncontinous parts of the Coverage are a result of discreet poisson distribution.
